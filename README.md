# Current TODOs
    # Implement an I2C Connection with a slave device that transmits AP Credentials with the Slave after the add_device protocol has been initated by the user.
        # This should be replaced with an NTAG NFC I2C Approach which requires more expensive hardware, but would result in a more user-friendly approach
            # the NFC Write Module would be an PN532, the Slave Sided passive/I2C module would be based on an NTAG I2C PLUS

    # Add an appropiate i2c/power adapter for master and slave
